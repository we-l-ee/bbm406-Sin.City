# Abstract
In the past decade machine learning solved countless every day problems in the society. Crimes are one of those problem we can try to solve it with machine learning. Every city has properties such as population distribution by gender, race, income and police force that we can define by budget, policeman per 100k citizen etc. Using data we already keep we can predict cities needs of law enforcement or changes the city needs. Let`s start an example. Imagine a city council trying to find a way to spent their budget in a best way that reduces the crime rates. Every member of the council gives an argument that their way of spending is the best. One of them supports his/her argument with our machine learning tool in which we can see the prediction that the crimes rates are lower than current year with his/her budget. After a year the prediction might be totally wrong or just slightly but it does not matter. We now have new years data that we can train our tool with it. This estimation in time will get only better and might give city counsel tie-breaker in their arguments! Of course this is only one example usage of our machine learning tool. We can use it to estimate crimes for next year by giving properties that we have not much control over and estimate cities feature!
